			<h1>Support for HTTPREQ based record updates.</h1>

			This is now supported under the main API at <a href="http://api.mydnshost.local.df.vg/1.0/docs/#httpreq">http://api.mydnshost.local.df.vg/1.0/docs/#httpreq</a>

			The old experimental endpoints will continue to be supported for a while, but are now just proxies through to the main api.
